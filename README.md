# M133-ProjectTracker-Ash

**What is this website**
<br>
This is basically a project tracker made as a project for BZZ M133.<br>
Think of this webapplication as Jira or Trello. Just a very cheap version of it :D
The main purpose of this is to keep an organized life, even with hundreds of unfinished projects on your hand.
You will also be able to add patchnotes in finished projects :)

**Functions**
<br>
<i>Will be added later</i>
